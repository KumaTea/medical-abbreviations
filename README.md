## Tasks

### Future Updates

Here's all the textbooks which I plan to collect abbrevations from:

* [ ] Systemic Anatomy
* [ ] Regional Anatomy
* [ ] Histology and Embryology
* [ ] Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
* [ ] Physiology
* [ ] Pathology
* [ ] Immunology
* [ ] Microbiology
* [ ] Diagnostics
* [ ] Pharmacology
* [ ] Pathophysiology
* [ ] Parasitology

... and subjects I haven't learned yet.

### Verification

All translations and most Wikipedia links are automatically generated by programs. It's not likely to be 100% correct.

The `Verified` section means the specific word has been verified manually.
